;; Window management utilities
;;
;; Window-jump lets you easily navigate complex window layouts. Spaces
;; helps you name and manage complex window layouts. Splitter lets you
;; easily declare and apply sophisticated window layouts, create grids
;; of windows, and intelligently shrink a window layout to create room
;; for a new window.
;;
;; See https://github.com/chumpage/chumpy-windows for more
;; documentation, and to submit patches.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'window-jump)
(require 'splitter)
(require 'spaces)

(provide 'chumpy-windows)
